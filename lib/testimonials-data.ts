      "I had the tremendous honour and pleasure of working with Morgan, during my mission at Disneyland Paris. Morgan was instrumental in the establishment of a design process, aiming to improve the usability and overall user experience of the Disneyland Paris' website, which was at that point going through an extensive revamping exercise. Morgan oversaw several initiatives, aiming to improve Information Architecture, user flows, while also addressing key usability issues that were identified. His capacity to work with different teams, including those of user research and analytics, helped reinforce design processes and rituals. He was a team player, highly professional and always kept an open mind (through a user-centered mindset), facilitating and unblocking the work of the team. For this reason, I strongly recommend Morgan for any UX and Product Design-related roles and I believe that he will be a strong asset for any design team he will be member of.",

      "Morgan is amazing. That's the only line you really need to remember. From my first day at Disney, Morgan helped me understand the product through his design vision. Over time, we worked together on many projects, but one, in particular, stands out. Morgan initiated an A/B testing strategy for displaying prices per person and per night, which won us an AB Tasty award for the most ROI-driven campaign of the year, as well as a Contentsquare award. It's always a pleasure to collaborate, brainstorm, and spend time with Morgan. He's very open-minded and always in a good mood. He's exactly the kind of person every team is looking for!",
